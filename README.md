1. I used node version 14.5.3 but I believe a range of recent versions should work (yarn version 1.22.10)
2. Download the repo, run 'yarn' to install the dependencies, then scripts 'yarn cy' to open the UI or 'yarn cy:run' for a headless run.
3. I used the testing library plugin to help make finding elements more concise and readable https://testing-library.com/
